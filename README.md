# equine-diagnosis
Design Special Topic 5 group project being completed at the University of Glasgow.
This project will involve the development of both hardware and software that controls a piezoelectric transducer, which will allow a camera to take a picture of the red blood cells of horses. This will allow the quick and convinient identification of parisites in equine blood.
